# Data Pipelines - Comparing Airflow and Luigi by people who have made mistakes in both
This repository contains the code examples from the talk.

### Abstract
Data is Twiggle's bread and butter, so choosing the right data pipelining framework was critical for us. After comparing Luigi and Airflow pipelines we ended up selecting both! Weâ€™ll explain why, present our unique challenges and chosen solutions.

### Description
Organizing and scaling data pipelines is a common challenge many organizations face. Luigi and Airflow are the two most popular open source frameworks to help solve this task. We will present a quick overview and comparison of the two. Then we will take a deep dive, including code examples, into the special cases for which we used the frameworks at Twiggle.

Among the examples we will discuss: Airflow as a highly available web server, and extending it with APIs for customers. Data processing using Dask and Spark in Luigi. * Code reuse in Luigi vs Airflow.
